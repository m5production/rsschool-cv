## Notes about myself  
I've been working as a technical interpreter and translator for 10 years in [Nuclear physics institute](http://vniitf.ru/en). I was the first among my collegues who mastered *Computer Assisted Taranslation (CAT) tools*, namely [memoQ](https://www.memoq.com/). I used to study this technology myself through reading docs and guidelines. I used to work at various projects concerning physical security, spent nuclear fuel disposal and reprocessing, space protection of the Earth etc. Finally I reached the position of a team leader.  
   At the same time I was always fond of technical stuff and computer technologies. At some point, while dealing with Arduino, I came up with the idea that I lack coding skills and knowledge of algorithms. That's when I fell in love with coding and solving various coding problems.

## Code example
### *Stop gninnipS My sdroW!* KATA from CODEWARS
   Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed (Just like the name of this Kata). Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.  
```
function spinWords(string){
  
  let phrase = string.split(" ");
  
  for (let word = 0; word < phrase.length; word++){
    if(phrase[word].length >= 5)
      phrase[word] = 
        phrase[word]
        .split("")
        .reverse()
        .join("");
  }
  
  return phrase.join(" ");
}
```
